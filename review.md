Day 1: JavaScript Basics

Variables: Declaring variables using var, let, and const with different scoping rules.
Data Types: Understanding primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol) and reference types (objects, arrays, functions).
Operators: Using arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
Objects: Creating and accessing objects, adding properties, and understanding object methods.

Day 2: Advanced JavaScript Concepts
this Keyword: The value of this depends on the context (global, object, method, event handler).
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): Converting data to JSON format using JSON.stringify(), and parsing JSON data with JSON.parse().

Day 3: DOM Manipulation

getElementById() & querySelector(): Selecting HTML elements using these methods.
preventDefault(): Preventing the default behavior of events (e.g., preventing form submission).
Working with JSON: Fetching data from APIs and manipulating it in the DOM.

Day 4: Promises and Async/Await

Promises: Representing values that may be available now or in the future, handling asynchronous code with then() and catch().
async/await: Writing asynchronous code in a synchronous style using async functions and await.
fetch: Making network requests to retrieve data from APIs.
setTimeout(): Deferring code execution after a set amount of time.

Day 5: Advanced Functions

Constructor Functions: Using functions to create new objects with shared properties and methods.
Factory Functions: Functions that return objects, providing an alternative to constructor functions.
Prototypes: Defining methods on an object's prototype, allowing shared functionality across instances.
Inheritance: Creating inheritance-like structures by using prototypes to extend objects.
